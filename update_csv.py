"""Record your progress in rtl_challenge_db.csv.

`make sim` drops a marker file in a question folder when that language passes
all tests:  PASS_SV, PASS_VHDL, or PASS_TLV.  This script sweeps every question
folder, looks for those markers, and writes SV / VHDL / TLV columns into the
CSV (the cell shows "PASS" where you've solved it, blank otherwise).

Usage (from the repo root):
    python3 update_csv.py
